# Classifier Practice
Repository to store tests for learning about classifiers

## MNIST
Classic feed forward network. Achieved 97% accuracy on an independent test set.

## CIFAR10
Using a residual network. This is an example on the Keras website (link in sources). This part is still a WIP. It currently manages a 91.5% accuracy.
